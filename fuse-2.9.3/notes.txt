hello_getattr: Determines whether the path is a file or directory
hello_readdir: Checks to see whether the given path is a directory, then fills up the buffer with the contents of the directory. The buffer is what gets printed out to the screen
hello_open: checks to see whether the file exists, and then opens it
hello_read: checks to see whether the file exists, finds the corresponding string, then loads the string into the buffer to be displayed.

Approach:
	- Created a table with path names and corresponding strings
	- Everything in the table is a file (for now).
	- Mimicked the hello world example in order to get ls and cat to work on all the files.

Going forward:
	- Change the files into directories
	- Create all the doc files and their contents
	- Implement the path recognition (use strtok for it)
